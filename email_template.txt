Hi $giver,

You Secret Santa Partner is...


Listed at the bottom so it won't show up in email previews :)


Please get started by creating a public wish list for yourself on Amazon. You should select items around $price_limit or less, provide several options for your secret santa to choose from. Each person will receive one gift valued at approximately $price_limit from their secret santa. You may add items from any site, but with time running out it is probably best to only include Amazon Prime items.


After you have created your list check Amazon for the list created by $receiver so you can find them a gift that they want.
You should choose either one gift valued at $price_limit for them, or several gifts totalling $price_limit. I recommend 1 gift as it is likely to be nicer.


Now be sure to keep it a secret! Don't even tell $sig_other, and above all certainly don't tell $receiver.


--------------  $receiver --------------



Merry Christmas,

- Devin


P.S. This email selection was generated from a little program I wrote, so I don't even know who your partner is!
